# ireland-weather-data
This repo is for my Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Project.

In this project, we were required to choose a dataset online, and tasked with finding interesting and unexpected insights into the data. More details on the project brief are outlined in the `brief.pdf` file.

I chose a dataset which contains hourly weather data from 20 weather stations around Ireland for up to 30 years (depending on the station).
- I specifically focused on the Valentia Island weather station, as this is closest to my hometown in Ireland.
- This station contains data from 1992 to 2022.

My goal is to observe the trends of weather over the years, such as:
- The effects of climate change on the precipitation/temperature/wind throughout different seasons
- The changes in the weather of night vs day (seems like storms always come at night?)
- Search for the frequency of "heat waves"
- Relationships between the different variables
